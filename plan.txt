Objective: Create a smart garbage bin.

Purpose: 
On a macro-level (cities), the municipality can identify which bins are full around the city through a network. By emptying the garbage bins taht are near-
full, they wlil never overflow. It will decrease the amount of overflowing garbage on the streets, keeping it sanitary. Also, the garbage trucks would only
have to empty those specific bins. The current routinely-run garbage truck trips can be optimized, which will lessen the emissions released from the trucks and
conserve more energy.
On a micro-level (individual houses), the residents will be notified on how full the bin is through a mobile app so they can take out the garbage.
The garbage bins can be operated using solar power by installing solar panels on the outer surfaces. The bins can recharge themselves with renewable energy.
